# Michael Reickerd Web-Development Portfolio

## Description
The Michael Reickerd Portfolio Website was created as a contact and display hub for my previous work. It contains information required to contact me, a summary of me, and links to recent projects I have completed. The website was completed with the use of HTML and CSS. This way if anyone was in search for someone of my capabilities, one must simply load my website to see any information they desire of me. Over the development of the site, I drastically imporved my abilities within CSS and more specifically, web displays.
